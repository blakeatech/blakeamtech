## About Me

I'm a machine learning engineer who builds end-to-end systems with a focus on robustness, modular design, and real-world deployment.

My work spans advanced ML pipelines—multimodal models, agent-based workflows, and fine-tuned architectures—wired into production-ready platforms with clean APIs, modern frontends, and solid infrastructure (Docker, CI/CD).

From semantic search with FAISS and Weaviate to scalable FastAPI services and LangGraph orchestration, I care deeply about traceability, monitoring, and maintainable design. Every repo is built like a product: clear architecture, clean code, and ready to ship.
